# Churn-Analysis
Churn analysis is the process of understanding why customers stop using a product or service (customer churn) and identifying patterns or factors contributing to this behavior. This analysis is crucial for businesses aiming to improve customer retention and reduce the associated costs of acquiring new customers.
# Key Concepts in Churn Analysis
Churn Rate:
The percentage of customers who stop using a product or service over a specific period.
Formula:

Churn Rate = Number of Customers Lost in a Period/Total Customers at the Start of the Period *100

# Types of Churn:

Voluntary Churn: When a customer chooses to leave (e.g., cancels a subscription).
Involuntary Churn: When a customer leaves due to external factors (e.g., payment failures).
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):
Estimating how much revenue a business can generate from a customer over their lifetime. Reducing churn increases CLV.

# Key Points to Address in the Dashboard
Identify Customers at Risk of Churn:

Leverage data analytics to build predictive models that classify customers into "low," "medium," and "high" churn risk categories.
Highlight these risk levels visually on the dashboard.
Proactive Retention Strategies:

Provide insights into customer behavior, such as usage trends, complaints, or delayed payments, to take proactive measures before churn happens.
Clear Visualization for Management:

Focus on creating charts and metrics that are intuitive and self-explanatory:
Customer distribution by churn risk.
Monthly churn rate trends.
Retention success rate metrics.

Customer demographics and usage patterns.
Historical vs. Predictive Insights:
Include past churn trends (historical data) to understand patterns.
Incorporate predictive metrics for future churn risks using machine learning models.
# Steps to Build the Dashboard
Data Understanding and Preparation:

Source: Utilize data provided by the Retention Manager. This likely includes customer demographics, contract details, usage patterns, support tickets, and payment histories.
Clean Data: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats for consistency.
Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features such as:
Time since last purchase/interaction.
Frequency of service usage.
Payment regularity or delays.
Complaint resolution times.

Dashboard Design:

Use tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Excel for visualization. Key components:
KPI Section:
Total customers.
Churn rate.
Retention success rate.
Risk Categorization Chart:
Pie or bar chart showing customer segmentation by churn risk.
Trend Analysis:
Line charts showing monthly churn rate trends over time.
Geographical Insights (if applicable):
Map visualization to show churn distribution by region.
Demographics and Behavior:
Age group, gender, or income level breakdown.
Usage habits like call duration, internet data usage, etc.
